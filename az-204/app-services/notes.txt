Topics to study:

- App Service Plans
-- App Service Domains
-- DNS zones
-- SSL Cert integration

- Azure Container Registry
- Azure container instances

Non-isolated and Isolated service plan types

Non-Isolated App Serive Plans:
- free and shared --> good for testing and very inexpensive and runs on shared infrastructure.
- Basic (B1, B2, B3) --> good tooling for apps that require a little 
- Standard (S1, S2, S3) --> app service plan for PROD with a dedicated app-service
- Premium v2  and v3 --> upgraded for large prod.

Isolated App Service Environment (ASE):
- fully isolated and dedicated env for running webapps
- high scale, high memory use.
- isolation and secure network access.
- fine-grained control over network traffic.
- apps can connect over VPN to on-premises resources.

Securing a Domain with SSL/TLS binding:
- App service plan neets to be on Basic, Standard or Premium sku
- Public vs Private certificate must be set taking into consideration the availability of the plan.
- Managed vs un-managed certs.
- You can enforce TLS versions and HTTPs

Auto scaling is only available in non-dev pricing tiers: basic, standard, premium.
App service instances have implicit load-balancers in their service plan to distribute traffic alongside
the service plan machine instances.

When attaching a valid domain name to the app service, you need to create an "App Service Domain"
which will create a DNS zone to configure any DNS entries.
